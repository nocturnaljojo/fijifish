# FijiFish — Session Log

Running log of what was built, decided, or unblocked each session. Claude reads this at session start (alongside `CLAUDE.md`) to pick up context.

Format: newest session on top. Each entry is a heading + short bullet list. Run `/wrap-up` at end of session to append.

## Session 1 — 2026-04-09 — Phase 0 scaffold
- Abandoned the OneDrive-hosted prototype (Vite/React + stuck git worktree handle) and relocated to `C:\dev\fijifish\`.
- Scaffolded Next.js 16.2.3 via `create-next-app@latest` with TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, App Router, `src/` dir, `@/*` import alias, npm.
- Set up Claude Code project structure: `CLAUDE.md` + `FIJIFISH-WEBAPP-SPEC-v3.md` at root, 12 skills under `.claude/skills/`, empty `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/commands/` placeholders.
- Added `.env.example` listing Clerk, Supabase, Stripe, Twilio, Mapbox env vars (no real secrets committed).
- Fresh git repo on `main`, wired to `https://github.com/nocturnalJojo/fijifish.git`.
- Next.js version is 16.2.3 (latest) rather than 14 quoted in the spec — latest is fine, spec was written earlier.
- **Not yet set up:** Clerk, Supabase, Stripe, Twilio, Mapbox. Bare Next.js scaffold only.

### Next up (Phase 0 continuation)
- [ ] Clerk integration (4 roles, middleware, webhook sync to Supabase `users` table)
- [ ] Supabase project in AU region + full v3 migration (see `FIJIFISH-WEBAPP-SPEC-v3.md` §11)
- [ ] Seed: Galoa village, 5–7 species + seasons, delivery zones, test flight window
- [ ] Vercel deploy
